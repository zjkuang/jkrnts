(1) mobx-state-tree, mobx-react-lite, async-storage, mst-persist
`yarn add mobx mobx-state-tree mobx-react-lite @react-native-async-storage/async-storage mst-persist`
-- Note that async-storage has a bug working with MST so we turned to @react-native-async-storage/async-storage.

(2) i18next
`yarn add i18next`

// To fix Android error "i18next::pluralResolver: Your environment seems not to be Intl API compatible, use an Intl.PluralRules polyfill"
// https://stackoverflow.com/a/70865185/7455975
`yarn add intl-pluralrules`

(3) react-navigation
